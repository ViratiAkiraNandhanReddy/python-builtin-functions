# Images Directory

This folder contains image assets used across the project, including banners, icons, previews, and UI visuals.

## Purpose
- Store static images referenced in documentation and README files
- Provide visuals for GitHub previews and project pages
- Keep media assets organized and reusable

## Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Prefer optimized formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.webp`)
- Avoid unused or duplicate images
